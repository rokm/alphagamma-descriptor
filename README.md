# AlphaGamma keypoint descriptor #

**Prototype & evaluation framework**

(C) 2015-2017, Rok Mandeljc


## Summary

This project contains the prototype implementation of the AlphaGamma
keypoint descriptor, presented in:

1. R. Mandeljc, D. Skoƒçaj, and J. Maver, AGs: local descriptors based on
dependent effects model, submitted to TPAMI


The code is provided as supplement to the TPAMI submission [1], and
provides reference/prototype implementation of the AlphaGamma descriptor,
as well as the RADIAL keypoint detector. In addition, experimental
framework and scripts for reproducing the experimental results from
the paper are provided.

The sections below outline the installation and setup, basic use of the
code, and steps needed to reproduce the experiments.
